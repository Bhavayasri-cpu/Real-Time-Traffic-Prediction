# Real-Time-Traffic-Prediction
🚦 Real-time traffic prediction system using Machine Learning to forecast traffic flow based on live or historical data.
📌 Project Overview
This project predicts real-time traffic conditions using Machine Learning techniques. The model is trained on traffic datasets and is capable of estimating traffic flow/congestion based on input parameters such as time, location, and vehicle count.
🎯 Features
Predicts traffic congestion level
Data preprocessing and feature extraction
Trained ML model for traffic forecasting
Real-time prediction support (optional)
Visualization of traffic patterns (if included)
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib / Seaborn
Flask / Streamlit (if you used it)
Jupyter Notebook
